            <p>Outcome 1: The ability to Analyze and synthesize complex text and attribute them to your paper with proper citations and formatting.</p>
            <p>This is exemplified in the ePortfolio specifically in the formation of the summaries where we had to analyze 6 complex scholarly articles asses them for their credibility and cite them accordingly. The summaries had to be concise enough to fit the necessary information to gain a rough understanding of the article while remaining under 350 words. This task was a challenge which is why it works perfectly as a showcase piece.</p>

            <p>The completed synthesis matrix hammers in the method of searching and analyzing these complex texts and grouping them together to be synthesized against each other. The synthesis matrix breaks down how I found the articles by showing the specific search terms that I used for each piece. It also shows key take away from each article as well as how it relates to other articles in the matrix which perfectly highlights the idea of synthesis a critical part of the first outcome. Between this piece and the annotated bibliography, I have completely showcased outcome one.</p>
