            <p>Outcome 3: The collection, analysis and interpretation of data to support a well-founded rhetorical argument</p>
            <p>The main sections Iâ€™m focusing on are the results and the discussions. The results were more taken from a statistical approach where I highlighted findings that I found interesting or unexpected. Then I used these results that I gained from statistical analysis and used them to support my arguments and come to generalized conclusions on my topic. I believe that the data I collected really shines in the discussion where I use it to support my argument which was the main focus of the paper. For example when I spoke about human subjects and how people tend to engage more with a photo they can feel as if they were apart of which was deduced by the data supporting human subjects being the highest performing subjects.</p>
