        <p>My name is Benjamin Carmenate I am a full time student at UCF studying computer science. On the side of studying I do photography which was the basis for my research in this class. This class has helped me learn about not only writing and rhetoric but how to use rhetoric to increase engagement in my photography career as well. Not only does this class apply to my photography career but also my career as a data scientist where I will have to research topics i am unfamiliar with and collect and produce accurate data to come to conclusions in different fields.</p>
