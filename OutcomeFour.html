            <p>Outcome 4: The ability to step back, look at, and analyze your own writing to assess your own opinions of your writing journey</p>
            <p>The ePortfolio Proposal represents outcome four because it looks at my past assignment analyzes their strengths and utilities which can later be capitalized on in the final ePortfolio. Not only does it analyze their strengths it analyzes their importance in my general understanding and take away from this course. It highlights how I used my previous writing knowledge and applied it to a completely new form of research and writing. Without this paper I would not have analyzed and reflected on my strengths and weaknesses as a writer. Similarly it also analyzes the relevance of each piece to the eportfolio itself.</p>

            <p>Another perfect is this website where I reflect on each piece idividually and determine exactly why they applied to each outcome which shows I am able to analyze my own work and determine if I met course standards. I was also able to understand my performance enough to defend an argument of course success which is vastly important to outcome four, not only outcome four but the entirety of writing as a whole.</p>
