        <p>Welcome to my ePortfolio, where you have direct access to my best work from ENC 1102. I have chosen to display the papers that I found to be the best example and representation of the outcomes that should have beeen derived from the completion of this course. Each piece will be accompanied by a short paragraph as to exactly why it was included in this portfolio.</p>
        <p>I was used to writing papers in the format that we wrote in this course because I did a lot of technical writing in my previous college level labs. Since I already had experience writing papers, especially technical experiment-based papers, I found most of the work in this course to be in my comfort zone especially methods of data collection and analysis. Therefore I chose a success portfolio to highlight the strengths in my writing. </p>
