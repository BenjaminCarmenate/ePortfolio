            <p>Outcome 2: engage in writing and research that studies rhetoric related to something you care about and affects a specific community.</p>
            <p>The methodology and research objective portion of the final research proposal start outcome two by starting the research process of inquiry-based research. The research question was something I specifically found meaningful as a photographer and I felt would affect my community of photographers, so I deviced a methodology behind my research to produce a result that my photographer community would find useful. I feel that if you look specifically at my research gap which is the last paragraph of my literature review, it exemplifies the ability to deduce shortcommings in research which builds into a research wuestion to guide you in research. This guiding question allowed me to build my methodology and create a process that would thoroughly investigate and discover the topic i chose which was what makes a photograph a good photograph.</p>
